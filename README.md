### ðŸ’¡ **Recommendations / Next Steps**

1. **Model Optimization**:

   * Consider **LASSO regression** for feature selection in high-dimensional blocks like `explicit_emotional`.
   * Use **PCA or Factor Analysis** if many predictors are collinear or conceptually similar.

2. **Model Combination**:

   * Combine the best-performing blocks (e.g., explicit + personality) in a **composite model** to improve predictive power.

3. **Qualitative Analysis**:

   * Analyze the `Qualitative reasons` column using NLP techniques (topic modeling, sentiment analysis) to enhance interpretability.

4. **Model Diagnostics**:

   * Check residual plots, VIF (Variance Inflation Factor), and potential outliers or leverage points for robustness.
